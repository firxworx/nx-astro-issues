# nx-astro (@rfx/nx-astro-plugin)

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Dependency Graph Plugins

```ts
// While developing your plugin, you can disable the project graph cache by setting the environment variable
// NX_CACHE_PROJECT_GRAPH=false. This ensures that Nx recalculates the project graph every time, which can be
// helpful during development.

// To ensure you can see any console.log statements you add during development, set NX_DAEMON=false.
```

## Building

Run `pnpm nx build nx-astro` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `pnpm nx test nx-astro` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
